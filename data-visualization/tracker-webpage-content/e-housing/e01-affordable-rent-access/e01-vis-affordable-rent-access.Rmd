# 3 visuals for webpage
This code will help produce the three visuals that are going to be a part of each equity tracker indicator webpage: regional map (tract level) of most recent data, chart of the most recent data, chart of trends over time.
\
\
**If the indicator is a PUMS/OPSI indicator that can be accessed through Elmer.** Getting the data to a workable version may require some data transformation. To explore, clean, transform, and generate a final data set, please use the *data-gen-pums-template*. This script will generate an .rda for the map and an .rda for the charts. These data sets will be loaded in before the data visualization code.  

## Indicator Explanation
Access to affordable rent allows people to choose to live in neighborhoods with the communities, services, and amenities that can support their households to thrive. Increasing access to housing provides greater opportunity for all people to choose safe and stable homes to meets their needs.

For this measure, we are focused on renter households and define a census tract as affordable (i.e., having access to affordable rent) if its median gross rent is equal to or less than 30% of the median household income for renters within the region or for a specific group. Across the region or a county, the share of affordable census tracts is calculated to represent the proportion of neighborhoods that is accessible to a typical renter household.

## 1. Map of most recent data
To map data in this form, it requires accessing data at the regional/tract level from ACS since the Elmer data set is already aggregated to equity group/quintile. 

### Create Visual
```{r map .rda}
year <- "2022" # most recent year

# load map .rda

                    "rda-data",
                    paste0(file_names$map,'.rda')))
``` 

```{r data format - map, include=FALSE}
# This space is for any data transformations that may be needed before the final visualizations are generated. This code may or may not be necessary depending on the way the data were formatted in the data-gen script and saved in the rda.

1. 42%: Share of tracts in the region where rent is affordable based on the regional median household income
2. 1%: Regionally, 1% of census tracts are affordable to renter households with limited English proficiency, 46X less than the what is affordable to English-proficient renter households (46%)
3. 2.5X: The share of tracts with affordable rent decreased 45% for renters of color between 2012 and 2022, about 2.5 times more than the decrease for white non-Hispanic renters (38%)

\

#### Insights & Analysis

* Regional affordability threshold for monthly rent, based on 30% of the regional median household income for renters (\$71,91000/year), is \$1,800.
* Access to affordable rent is highest in Pierce (65% of tracts), followed by Kitsap County (64%), Snohomish (43%), and King (31%).
* Ten census tracts tied with the highest median gross rent ($3,500) are all in King County: one is in Seattle (Montlake neighborhood), two are in southern Mercer Island, two are in Clyde Hill/Hunts Point/Medina/Yarrow Point, four are in Bellevue, one is in Auburn (West Hill).
* The highest median gross rent in Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish County are in: the southeastern portion of Bainbridge Island (\$2,720), Tehaleh community south of Bonney Lake (\$3,090), and the Edmonds/southern Mukilteo area (\$3,280), respectively. 
* Relatively affordable areas are in south Seattle, south King County, Tacoma/central Pierce County, along the I-5 corridor in Snohomish County and in communities farther out from the region’s urban centers.

#### Insights & Analysis

* Renters with a disability have access to affordable rent in 3% of the region’s census tracts. 
* There is a 53 percentage point difference in the regional share of affordable tracts between renter households with older adults (1%) and other renter households (54%).
* Renters of color in King County have access to affordable rent in 32% of the census tracts, while white non-Hispanic renters may find 57% of the tracts to be affordable, the largest difference among the counties.
* While the renter affordability gap between people of color and white non-Hispanic people is notable, it is likely even bigger for some racial subgroups (more information about the way in which housing opportunities are different among racial subgroups is available in the Regional Housing Strategy: 2023 Monitoring Report.
* For households living below 200% of poverty level, there is no access to affordable rent.
* The disparity in access to affordable rent between households with older adults and other households is greatest in King County (60%), followed by Kitsap (48%), Pierce (42%), and Snohomish (37%).

# Transfer files
## Copy files from Github > Y drive/update folder
This step will transfer all of the Rmd output files (html and docx) to the network for review. It will keep the Rmd files within GitHub so that code is kept in a central place. 
```{r to y drive, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set folder structure
current_folder <- file.path(getwd())
y.drive.folder.update <- file.path(file_names$base_dir,
                                   file_names$theme_dir,
                                   file_names$ind_dir,
                                   'update')

# isolate files in Github
list.of.files <- list.files(current_folder, 
                            full.names = T,
                            pattern = "\\.(html|docx)$")

# copy the files to the new folder
file.copy(from=list.of.files,
          to=y.drive.folder.update,
          overwrite = TRUE,
          recursive = TRUE)

# keep only .Rmd files in Github (cleaner)
files.in.dir <- list.files(current_folder, 
                            full.names = T)
files.to.keep <- list.files(current_folder, 
                            full.names = T,
                            pattern = "\\.(Rmd|R)$")
files.to.remove <- list(files.in.dir[!(files.in.dir %in% grep(paste(files.to.keep, collapse = "|"),
                                                              files.in.dir, value=TRUE))])
do.call(unlink, files.to.remove)
```

## Copy files from Y drive/indicator folder > Y drive/indicator/archive folder
This step will transfer the previous data and files to the archive folder. This step is meant to retain the older versions in case they are needed for reference. 
```{r to archive, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set folder structure
y.drive.folder <- file.path(file_names$base_dir,
                            file_names$theme_dir,
                            file_names$ind_dir)
archive.folder <- file.path(file_names$base_dir,
                            file_names$theme_dir,
                            file_names$ind_dir,'archive')

# isolate old files/directories
list.of.files <- list.files(y.drive.folder, 
                            full.names = T,
                            pattern = "\\.(html|docx)$|rda-data|webpage-html-outputs")

# copy the files to the archive folder
file.copy(from=list.of.files,
          to=archive.folder,
          overwrite = TRUE,
          recursive = TRUE)
```

### Delete old files from indicator folder
This step will clean the indicator folder to make room for the new versions.
```{r clean indicator folder, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# identify html and docx files to remove
list.of.files <- list.files(y.drive.folder,  
                            full.names = T,
                            pattern = "\\.(html|docx)$",
                            recursive=F)
# clean the files from the update folder
files.to.remove <- list(list.of.files)
do.call(unlink, files.to.remove)

# # identify map_files sub-directory, wanted to keep the rda-data and webpage-html-outputs folders
# map.files.dir <- list.dirs(file.path(y.drive.folder, 'webpage-html-outputs'),
#                            full.names = T,
#                            recursive=F)
# 
# # clean the files from the update folder
# dir.to.remove <- list(map.files.dir)
# unlink(dir.to.remove, recursive=T)
```

## Copy new files from Y drive/update folder > Y drive/indicator folder
Once the data and planning reviews are complete, this step will move all of the updated data/files to the general indicator folder. They should be moved from the update (draft staging directory) to the parent folder so that the htmls can be copied to the webpage folder (outside the firewall).
```{r update to indicator folder, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# isolate old files/directories
list.of.files <- list.files(y.drive.folder.update, 
                            full.names = T)

# copy the files to the new folder
file.copy(from=list.of.files,
          to=y.drive.folder,
          overwrite = TRUE,
          recursive = TRUE)
```

## Clear Y drive/update folder
This step will help keep the folders organized and ready for the next update. 
```{r clear update, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# clean the map files from the indicator/webpage-html-outputs folders
# identify files/data to remove
list.of.files <- list.files(y.drive.folder.update, 
                            full.names = T,
                            pattern = "\\.(html|docx|rda)$",
                            recursive=T)
# clean the files from the update folder
files.to.remove <- list(list.of.files)
do.call(unlink, files.to.remove)

# the webpage-html-output and rda files will get overwritten, but the map_files folder is still in the webpage-html-outputs folder

# identify map_files sub-directory, wanted to keep the rda-data and webpage-html-outputs folders
map.files.dir <- list.dirs(file.path(y.drive.folder.update, 'webpage-html-outputs'),
                           full.names = T,
                           recursive=F)

# clean the files from the update folder
dir.to.remove <- list(map.files.dir)
unlink(dir.to.remove, recursive=T)
```

## Copy files from Y drive/indicator folder > website folder
This step copies the htmls for the webpage (3 visuals) from the network to the folder outside the firewall- this 'external' folder connects directly to the webpage.
```{r to web dev folder, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set folder structure
current_folder <- file.path(file_names$base_dir,
                            file_names$theme_dir,
                            file_names$ind_dir,
                            'webpage-html-outputs')

web.base.folder <- '//WEB/website_data/equity-tracker-webpages'
new.folder <- file.path(web.base.folder,
                        file_names$theme_dir)

list.of.files <- list.files(current_folder, 
                            full.names = T)
# list.of.files

# copy the files to the new folder
file.copy(list.of.files,
          new.folder,
          overwrite = T)
```
